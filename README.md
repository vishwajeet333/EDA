# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository documents my journey in mastering **Exploratory Data Analysis**. 

The main focus is to understand data deeply through visual and statistical analysis, uncovering patterns, relationships, and insights using Python libraries.

Applied various EDA techniques to analyze datasets:

* **Univariate Analysis:** Analyzing single variables to understand their distribution and spread.
* **Bivariate Analysis:** Exploring relationships between two variables (eg correlation, scatter plots).
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Analyzing interactions between multiple variables simultaneously to identify complex patterns.
* **Automated Profiling:** Generating comprehensive reports using `ydata-profiling` (formerly pandas-profiling).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **YData Profiling**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
